# ExpenseEcho - Local Android Expense Tracker

ExpenseEcho is a privacy-focused Android expense tracking app that automatically captures bank SMS notifications and categorizes transactions locally on your device.

## Features

### ðŸ”’ Privacy First
- **100% Local Storage**: All data stays on your device, encrypted with SQLCipher
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Works completely offline
- **SMS Notification Parsing**: Uses NotificationListenerService (Play Store compliant)
- **Encrypted Backups**: Local encrypted export/import functionality

### ðŸ’° Smart Transaction Management
- **Automatic SMS Parsing**: Captures amount, merchant, date, and account info from bank SMS
- **Auto-Categorization**: Rule-based keyword matching (e.g., "KFC" â†’ Food)
- **Account Filtering**: Only processes transactions for your specified account (`****0030-1******6809`)
- **Manual Entry**: Add/edit transactions with quick FAB interface

### ðŸ“Š Financial Insights
- **Dashboard**: Monthly income, expenses, net savings, and savings rate
- **Category Breakdown**: Visual spending analysis by category
- **Budget Tracking**: Set and monitor monthly category budgets
- **Debt Management**: Track credit cards and loans with debt avalanche strategy

### ðŸŽ¯ Modern Tech Stack
- **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose**: Modern Android UI
- **Room + SQLCipher**: Encrypted local database
- **Hilt**: Dependency injection
- **Material 3**: Beautiful, adaptive design
- **WorkManager**: Background backup operations

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ExpenseEcho.git
cd ExpenseEcho
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### 2. Enable SMS Notification Access
1. Install the app on your Android device (API 26+)
2. Open the app and go to Settings
3. Tap "Open Notification Settings"
4. Enable notification access for ExpenseEcho
5. Grant permission to read notifications

### 3. Configure Account Filter
The app is pre-configured to filter SMS for account mask `****0030-1******6809`. To change this:
1. Edit `SmsNotificationListenerService.kt`
2. Update the `TARGET_ACCOUNT_MASK` constant
3. Rebuild and reinstall

## How It Works

### SMS Parsing
The app uses `NotificationListenerService` to capture SMS notifications from messaging apps and extracts:
- **Amount**: Supports PKR and Rs. formats with commas
- **Transaction Type**: Credit, Debit, or Funds Transfer
- **Merchant**: Location/merchant name using "at", "from", "to" patterns
- **Account**: Account mask from SMS content
- **Reference**: Transaction reference numbers

### Auto-Categorization
Pre-loaded rules automatically categorize transactions:
- KFC, McDonald's â†’ Food & Dining
- Daraz â†’ Shopping
- Uber, Careem â†’ Transportation
- PSO, Shell â†’ Fuel
- And many more...

### Example SMS Formats Supported
```
PKR 1,500.00 debited from Account ****0030-1******6809 at KFC DHA on 15-Jan-2025. Ref# ABC123

Rs. 250 spent using Debit Card ****0030-1******6809 at Metro Cash & Carry. Available balance PKR 45,000

Credit of PKR 50,000 received in Account ****0030-1******6809 from Salary Transfer. Balance: PKR 95,000
```

```

## Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **Account**: Bank accounts to track
- **Transaction**: Individual transactions with amount, date, category
- **Category**: Expense categories (Food, Transport, etc.)
- **Budget**: Monthly budget targets per category
- **Debt**: Credit cards and loans for debt tracking
- **Rule**: Auto-categorization rules (keyword â†’ category)

### Security
- SQLCipher encryption with randomly generated passphrase
- Passphrase stored in Android EncryptedSharedPreferences
- No plaintext sensitive data in app storage

## Privacy & Security

### Data Protection
- All financial data encrypted at rest using SQLCipher
- Database passphrase secured with Android Keystore
- No network permissions except for future backup features
- SMS content processed locally, never transmitted

### Permissions
- `BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE`: Required for SMS notification access
- `INTERNET`: Future Google Drive backup (user-initiated only)
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: Local backup exports

### Play Store Compliance
- Uses NotificationListenerService instead of READ_SMS permission
- No automatic SMS reading - only processes notifications
- Clear data usage disclosure in Data Safety form
- Local processing only, no server communication
